## Description
  This application is a simply designed progessive web app. It utilizes webpacks, service workers, and storage to create an easy to use text editor that functions in offline mode.
  
## Usage
  The application is deployed through Render, but you can run it on your local system. 
  Simply use the npm run build and npm run dev scripts and it will launch. Typing any text into
  the editor will work, and you can open up the browser's inspect tool and go to the application 
  tab to see the benefits of using a PWA.
  
## Installation
  The application uses express, babel, webpack, and concurrently. To install, just pull the files and run npm run build, then run npm start:dev to spin the application to life.
